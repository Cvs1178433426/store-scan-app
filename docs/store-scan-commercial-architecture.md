# Store Scan Commercial Architecture Direction

Status: architecture direction for `chatgpt-development`; no production schema changes are authorized by this document alone.

## Product objective

Store Scan is being developed as a reusable commercial platform for retailers, wholesalers, distributors, warehouses, and inventory-service organizations. The same product should be configurable for a single independent shop or a multi-site operator without maintaining customer-specific forks.

The core operational promise remains unchanged:

1. no lost physical scans;
2. no duplicate counts from retries;
3. extremely simple operation for counters;
4. reliable operation on poor Wi-Fi/cellular connectivity;
5. one counting pipeline for phones and Android hardware scanners.

Commercial architecture must preserve those guarantees while adding tenant and site boundaries.

## Current-state constraint

The current schema is still essentially single-installation. `User`, `Product`, `StoreLocation`, and `StoreCountSession` are globally scoped. That is acceptable for proving the counting engine, but it is not sufficient isolation for a commercial multi-customer service.

The inherited home-inventory domain (`Item`, nested `Location`, `AuditSession`, XP/consumer features, etc.) should not become the foundation of the commercial Store Scan domain. Existing functionality must not be removed casually; Store Scan should instead continue separating cleanly until legacy functionality can be deprecated or packaged separately by an explicit product decision.

## Target domain hierarchy

```text
Organization / Tenant
  ├─ Users + memberships + roles
  ├─ Product catalog
  ├─ Sites
  │   ├─ Retail store
  │   ├─ Warehouse
  │   ├─ Distribution center
  │   └─ Other facility
  │       └─ Store locations / zones / aisles / bins
  ├─ Count assignments
  └─ Count sessions
      └─ Count entries + immutable scan audit trail
```

### Organization

Represents the customer account/business boundary. Every commercially meaningful row must ultimately belong to exactly one organization.

Suggested fields:

- `id`
- `name`
- `slug`
- `isActive`
- `createdAt`
- optional branding/configuration fields later

### Membership and roles

A user should not have one global business role. A user may belong to one or more organizations with an organization-specific role.

Suggested initial commercial roles:

- `OWNER`
- `ADMIN`
- `MANAGER`
- `SUPERVISOR`
- `COUNTER`
- `VIEWER`

Use an `OrganizationMembership` join model rather than putting tenant role directly on `User`.

Authorization rule: tenant access is established from membership, never from a client-supplied organization id alone.

### Site

A customer may have one or many physical facilities. Use one neutral model so Store Scan works for retail and wholesale operations.

Suggested fields:

- `id`
- `organizationId`
- `code`
- `name`
- `type` (`STORE`, `WAREHOUSE`, `DISTRIBUTION_CENTER`, `OTHER`)
- address/time-zone metadata as needed
- `isActive`

Unique site codes should be organization-scoped, not globally unique.

### StoreLocation

The current flat StoreLocation concept remains appropriate for high-speed counting, but it should become site-scoped.

Target uniqueness:

`@@unique([siteId, code])`

Examples: aisle, department, stockroom, bay, bin, cooler, endcap, reserve area.

Do not reuse the inherited nested home-inventory `Location` model.

### Product catalog

The current dedicated `Product` model remains the Store Scan catalog. For commercial use it must be organization-scoped unless/until a deliberate global-product/master-data design is introduced.

Target uniqueness for the first commercial version:

`@@unique([organizationId, barcodeValue])`

This allows two customers to maintain different product descriptions/categories for the same UPC without leaking data between tenants.

External lookup cache may remain global if it contains only third-party/public lookup data and never customer-private overrides.

### Count assignment

Introduce assignments separately from active execution sessions once basic tenant/site scoping is stable.

An assignment can answer:

- which site should be counted;
- which zones are included;
- who is assigned;
- due date/status;
- optional expected inventory snapshot/reference.

Do not make assignment complexity block the simple walk-up `Start Count` flow for small customers.

### StoreCountSession

A session should eventually include:

- `organizationId`
- `siteId`
- optional `assignmentId`
- `startedById`
- status/timestamps

The one-active-session policy must be defined intentionally. Potential commercial policy options include one active session per user per site or one active session per user per assignment. Avoid assuming a global one-session rule forever once multi-site support exists.

### StoreCountEntry and scan audit

Entries remain aggregate quantities by session + location + barcode for fast summaries.

For commercial auditability, the scan/idempotency log should evolve into a durable event/audit record rather than being treated as disposable implementation detail. At minimum retain:

- physical-scan idempotency key
- session
- location
- barcode
- quantity delta
- timestamp
- user/device where practical
- outcome/status where practical

This supports investigation of disputes without sacrificing the aggregate-entry performance model.

## Tenant-isolation invariants

Before calling multi-tenant support complete, automated tests must prove:

1. Organization A cannot fetch Organization B products.
2. Organization A cannot use Organization B site/location ids.
3. Organization A cannot access, scan, summarize, complete, edit, or cancel Organization B sessions.
4. Identical UPC values can exist independently in two organizations if organization-scoped catalogs are chosen.
5. Identical location codes can exist at different sites.
6. Admin privileges are organization-scoped; a tenant admin is not a platform-wide superuser.
7. Cross-tenant idempotency-key reuse can never expose another tenant's data.

## Migration strategy

Do not perform a big-bang rewrite. Preserve the now-tested counting engine.

### Phase 0 — current reliability work

Finish and verify:

- offline/reconnect reconciliation;
- Product-to-Store-Count regression coverage;
- hardware scanner workflow;
- actual device testing;
- current route-level concurrency/idempotency guarantees.

### Phase 1 — add Organization + Site foundations

Add organization/site tables and memberships without immediately deleting old models. Create a default organization/site migration path for current data.

Requirements:

- forward-only migration;
- disposable-database migration test;
- zero Prisma drift;
- explicit backfill verification;
- no change to count quantities during migration.

### Phase 2 — scope Store Scan domain

Add tenant/site foreign keys to Product, StoreLocation, StoreCountSession and relevant Store Count records. Update every Store Scan query to derive tenant scope from authenticated membership.

Add cross-tenant denial tests before expanding UI.

### Phase 3 — commercial administration

Add organization/site administration, membership management, role controls, imports/exports and configurable terminology/branding.

### Phase 4 — assignments/reporting/integrations

Add scheduled count assignments, reconciliation/approval workflows, richer audit reports, POS/ERP/WMS import/export/API integration and commercial operational tooling.

## API design direction

Avoid trusting tenant identifiers supplied in request payloads. Auth should establish accessible organizations/memberships, and handlers should query within that authorized scope.

Where a user belongs to multiple organizations, use an explicitly selected current organization/site context that is validated server-side on every request.

Every tenant-scoped database lookup should include the tenant boundary directly or be reached through a relation already proven to belong to that tenant.

## UX direction

Commercial complexity belongs primarily in manager/admin screens, not the counter workflow.

Counter experience should remain approximately:

```text
Sign in
→ choose/receive site or assignment
→ choose location
→ scan continuously
→ change location when needed
→ finish
```

A counter should not need to understand tenants, databases, sync queues, idempotency keys, provider lookups, or architectural concepts.

Managers may receive configuration, failed-scan reconciliation, product maintenance, assignment, export and reporting screens.

## Hardware/device direction

Keep one shared barcode handling pipeline independent of input source:

- phone camera decode;
- Android keyboard-wedge scanner;
- manual fallback;
- future native scanner integrations if needed.

Do not encode Zebra-, Honeywell-, or Datalogic-specific assumptions into the counting engine. Device-specific tuning belongs in adapters/input configuration.

## Commercial configuration direction

Plan for configurable organization-level settings rather than customer-specific forks:

- business name/logo;
- terminology (site/store/warehouse, aisle/bin/zone);
- barcode behavior;
- product/category conventions;
- count workflow options;
- locale/time zone;
- optional features by plan/customer.

## Data ownership and export

Commercial customers should be able to export their own core data. Design APIs/data models so future CSV/XLSX/API export can cleanly include:

- products;
- locations;
- users/memberships;
- sessions;
- entries;
- scan audit;
- summaries/reconciliation.

## Non-goals for the immediate reliability milestone

Do not interrupt current reliability/device-validation work by prematurely implementing:

- billing/subscriptions;
- elaborate enterprise SSO;
- complex ERP integrations;
- customer-specific forks;
- microservices solely for architectural fashion.

The immediate goal is a proven counting engine with clean seams for commercial scoping.

## Definition of architectural success

The architecture is commercially ready when we can demonstrate with automated integration tests that two independent organizations can coexist in the same deployment, use overlapping UPC/location values, and neither can read or mutate any Store Scan data belonging to the other, while both retain the same no-loss/no-duplicate/offline-safe counting guarantees already established for the single-organization workflow.
